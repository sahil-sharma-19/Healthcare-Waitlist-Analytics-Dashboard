# Healthcare-Waitlist-Analytics-Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard for healthcare institutions to monitor and analyze patient waitlists, case types, specialty trends, and demographic profiles. This project empowers healthcare administrators with actionable insights to optimize patient flow.
## Key Technologies Used

- *Power BI Desktop*  
  The main tool for designing, building, and publishing interactive dashboards and reports.

-*Power Query Editor*  
  Used within Power BI for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources including Excel files, CSVs, and databases.

-*Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)*  
  Power BIâ€™s formula language for calculations, advanced measures, KPIs, and custom analytics logic.

-*Data Modeling*  
  Structuring data tables, defining relationships, and creating schemas to enable detailed drilldowns and analysis.
## Data Source Information

The sample dataset illustrated here has been *synthesized for demonstration purposes* in the Healthcare Waitlist Analytics Dashboard. It is modeled to reflect real-world healthcare operations and typical patient records, including waitlist status, appointment scheduling, case types, and specialty assignments.

The fields and structure of the sample data are inspired by common attributes recorded in hospital waitlist and appointment management systems, such as:

- Patient demographics (ID, name, age, gender)
- Case and specialty information
- Waitlist and appointment dates
- Status tracking (e.g., waiting, complete).
## Features & Highlights

- *Comprehensive Waitlist Monitoring*
  - Track total patient waitlists across different case types (Inpatient, Outpatient, Day Case, etc.).
  - Analyze month-over-month trends for better capacity planning.

- *Case Type & Specialty Breakdown*
  - Visualize distribution of patients by case type and medical specialty.
  - Identify high-demand specialties and potential service bottlenecks.

- *Dynamic Filtering & Drilldown*
  - Filter data interactively by date range, case type, specialty, and age profile.
  - Drill down into granular patient demographics and specific service lines.

- *Age Profile Analytics*
  - Get detailed insights into patient waitlists by age group.
  - Identify cohorts with the longest average wait times.

- *Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)*
  - Monitor essential KPIs such as total waitlist, changes in monthly lists, and average/median wait times.

- *Interactive Visualizations*
  - Utilize pie/donut charts, bar and line graphs, cards, and slicers for intuitive data exploration.
  - Toggle easily between summary and detailed views.

- *Secure & Shareable*
  - Built-in Power BI access controls and row-level security for protecting sensitive data.
  - Deploy dashboards securely via the Power BI Service for collaboration with healthcare teams.
## Impact & Insights

- Streamlines hospital operations by highlighting patient backlogs and optimizing scheduling.
- Reduces wait times through timely, data-driven interventions.
- Improves patient satisfaction by making waitlist processes transparent.
- Enables leaders to make informed resource and staffing decisions.
- Tracks KPIs to boost departmental accountability and support performance improvement.
