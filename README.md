# Healthcare-Waitlist-Analytics-Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard for healthcare institutions to monitor and analyze patient waitlists, case types, specialty trends, and demographic profiles. This project empowers healthcare administrators with actionable insights to optimize patient flow.
## Key Technologies Used

- *Power BI Desktop*  
  The main tool for designing, building, and publishing interactive dashboards and reports.

- *Power Query Editor*  
  Used within Power BI for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources including Excel files, CSVs, and databases.

- *Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)*  
  Power BIâ€™s formula language for calculations, advanced measures, KPIs, and custom analytics logic.

- *Data Modeling*  
  Structuring data tables, defining relationships, and creating schemas to enable detailed drilldowns and analysis.
## Data Source Information

The sample dataset illustrated here has been *synthesized for demonstration purposes* in the Healthcare Waitlist Analytics Dashboard. It is modeled to reflect real-world healthcare operations and typical patient records, including waitlist status, appointment scheduling, case types, and specialty assignments.

The fields and structure of the sample data are inspired by common attributes recorded in hospital waitlist and appointment management systems, such as:

- Patient demographics (ID, name, age, gender)
- Case and specialty information
- Waitlist and appointment dates
- Status tracking (e.g., waiting, complete).
